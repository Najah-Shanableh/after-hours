Problem Statement
Clocking in at 60.6% in 2012, Chicago's high school graduation rate is on the rise but has a long way to go before the city will rest. One way to tackle this low graduation rate is by offering out-of-school programs to high-risk students. Then the question becomes, what is the impact of these programs?

Project Plan
Combining performance data from Chicago Public Schools and from participating partners, we will show out-of-school programs their impact on their participants.Â 

Impact
This project has two goals:
	1.	Show out-of-school programs their success with reaching out to at-risk students, their impact on student academics, and which efforts are the most promising for making that impact;
	2.	Start conversations among out-of-school programs about how they can effectively combine their resources to optimize the impact they are having
